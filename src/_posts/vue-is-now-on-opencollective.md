## Vue is now on OpenCollective!
Today we are happy to announce that we have started to accept financial contributions to the Vue project via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/vuejs).

## Why OpenCollective?
The question many will ask is probably “why OpenCollective when you already have a [successful Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou)?” — there are a few reasons:
- When I started the Patreon campaign, the primary goal was providing myself with enough income so that I can work on Vue full-time. Today, as the Vue community grows, there are more and more contributions from the community, and OpenCollective’s transparent expense model could help us scale the financial contributions beyond a single developer.
- OpenCollective is also a platform built with open source projects in mind. It has done a really great job engaging with the open source community, so sponsors also benefit from better community exposure. It’s very encouraging to see projects like [webpack](https://opencollective.com/webpack) thriving on OpenCollective.
- It also provides nice technical features such GitHub integration, automating backers listing, and invoice generation.

## What About Patreon?
The primary difference between our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou) and [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/vuejs) campaigns are that the funds donated via Patreon goes directly to support my full-time effort on Vue — so it is still critically important. The Patreon campaign will continue to accept donations and all current backer/sponsor perks will remain the same.

In comparison, funds donated to OpenCollective will be managed with transparent expenses — this allows us to use these funds to support major undertakings by core contributors, and sponsor community events such as meetups or even conferences.

No matter whether you are a freelancer or a company building core products using Vue, no matter which platform you choose, one thing is certain: your contributions will help keep Vue sustainable and make it better in the future.
